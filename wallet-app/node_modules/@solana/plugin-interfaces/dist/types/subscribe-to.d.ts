/**
 * Convention for advertising that a client capability is reactive.
 *
 * A plugin whose capability can change over time (for example, a wallet
 * plugin whose `client.payer` is reassigned as the user connects, switches
 * accounts, or disconnects) installs a sibling
 * `subscribeTo<Capability>(listener): () => void` function alongside the
 * capability itself. Reactive consumers (framework hooks, stores, effects)
 * can then observe changes without having to name the specific plugin that
 * installed the capability — they duck-type on the subscribe hook.
 *
 * The listener is invoked whenever the observable value of the capability
 * may have changed; consumers should re-read the capability to get the
 * current value. Over-notification is acceptable — consumers that bail on
 * reference-equal snapshots (such as React's `useSyncExternalStore`) will
 * filter redundant notifications out for free.
 *
 * Plugins whose capability is fixed for the lifetime of the client (e.g. a
 * static `payer(signer)` plugin) do not need to install this function.
 * Consumers that care about reactivity should fall back to a no-op subscribe
 * and read the capability once.
 *
 * This module defines the convention for `client.payer` and `client.identity`.
 * See {@link ClientWithSubscribeToPayer} and {@link ClientWithSubscribeToIdentity}.
