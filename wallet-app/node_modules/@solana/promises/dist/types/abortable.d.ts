/**
 * Returns `true` if the given value is an `Error` whose `name` is `'AbortError'`.
 *
 * When an {@link AbortSignal} fires without a custom `reason`, or when APIs like `fetch` are
 * aborted, they reject with a `DOMException` (or similar `Error` subclass) whose `name` is
 * `'AbortError'`. This helper lets callers distinguish abort rejections from other failures
 * without having to `instanceof`-check every platform-specific error class.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * try {
 *     await getAbortablePromise(doWork(), signal);
 * } catch (e) {
 *     if (isAbortError(e)) {
 *         // The operation was aborted; don't surface as an error.
 *         return;
 *     }
 *     throw e;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * @see {@link getAbortablePromise}
